      <h2>Specification of terms</h2>
      <p>
        In general, the terms &mdash; i.e., the properties and classes &mdash; used in the VCDM are formally specified in
        Recommendation Track documents published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc">W3C Verifiable Credentials
          Working Group</a> or, for some deprecated or reserved terms, in Reports published by the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/credentials">W3C Credentials Community Group</a>. In each case of such external
        definition, the term's description in this document contains a link to the relevant specification. Additionally, the
        `rdfs:definedBy` property in the RDFS representation(s) refers to the formal specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, a local explanation is necessary to complement, or to replace, the definition found in an external
        specification. For instance, this is so when the term is needed to provide a consistent structure to the RDFS
        vocabulary, such as when the term defines a common supertype for class instances that are used as objects of
        specific properties, or when <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-concepts/#section-rdf-graph">RDF Graphs</a> are
        involved. For such cases, the extra definition is included in the current document (and the `rdfs:comment` property
        is used to include them in the RDFS representations).
      </p>

      <h2>Diagram description</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>Overview diagram of the vocabulary (without the reserved and deprecated items, error codes, and `xsd` datatypes).</summary>
        <p>
          The diagram uses boxes, ellipses, and connecting lines with different "styles" 
          (border color, end marker, line type) to differentiate their semantic meaning; 
          these styles identify Property, Class, or Datatype, via the shapes used for the 
          graph nodes, and Superclass, Domain Of, Range, or Contains, via the styles of the connecting lines.
          These style names are used in the explanation text that follows, below.
        </p>
        <p>
          The diagram is roughly divided into left and right sections 
          (although there are some common nodes; see later).
          To make this description easier to understand, these will be referred to as the 
          "Proof Section" and the "Verification Section". 
          Each of these sections has an ellipse at the top, styled as Class, 
          and respectively labeled as "Proof" and "VerificationMethod".
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>Proof Section</h3>
          <p>
            The left side of the Proof Section contains another ellipse, 
            styled as Class and labeled as "ProofGraph", and connected
            to the ellipse labeled as "Proof" with a connecting line styled as Contains. 
            There is also a box, styled as Property and labeled as "proof",
            connected to the ellipse labeled as "ProofGraph"
            with a connecting line styled as Range.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two more ellipses in this section, styled as Class 
            and labeled as "Ed25519Signature2020" and "DataIntegrityProof",
            each connected to the ellipse labeled as "Proof"
            with connecting lines styled as Superclass. 
            The ellipse labeled as "DataIntegrityProof" is
            also connected to a box styled as Property, 
            and labeled as "cryptosuite", with a connecting 
            line styled as Domain Of. The "cryptosuite" Property box
            is connected to a shape
            styled as Datatype and labeled as
            "cryptosuiteString", with a connecting 
            line styled as Range.
          </p>
          <p>
            The right side of the Section contains a column of labeled boxes, 
            all styled as Property. The labels, from top to 
            bottom, are "previousProof", "domain", "challenge", "proofPurpose", 
            "nonce", "created", "proofValue". 
            The ellipse labeled as "Proof" is connected to all of these with 
            connecting lines styled as Domain Of. 
            The box labeled as "previousProof" is also connected to the ellipse 
            labeled as "Proof" with a connecting line styled as Range. 
            The box labeled as "proofValue" is connected to a shape styled as Datatype
            and labeled as "multibase", with a connecting line styled as Range.
            Finally, another box, styled as Property and labeled as "digestMultibase",
            is connected to the same "multibase" Datatype shape with
            a connecting line styled as Range.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>VerificationMethod Section</h3>

          <p>
            The right side of this Section contains a column of labeled boxes, 
            all styled as Property. The labels, from top to bottom, are 
            "verificationMethod", "authentication", "assertionMethod", 
            "capabilityDelegation", "capabilityInvocation", and "keyAgreement". 
            Each of these boxes is connected to 
            the ellipse labeled "VerificationMethod",
            with a connecting line styled as Range.
          </p>
          <p>
            The left side of this Section contains a column of three labeled 
            boxes, all styled as Property. The labels, from top to bottom, are 
            "expires", "controller", and "revoked". Each of these is connected
            to the ellipse labeled "VerificationMethod",
            with connecting lines styled as Domain Of.
            The "expires" Property box is also connected to the ellipse 
            labeled "Proof" in the Proof Section, with a connecting line 
            styled as Domain Of.
          </p>

          <p>
            The middle of this section contains three ellipses,
            styled as Class, and labeled as 
            "Multikey, "Ed25519VerificationKey2020", and "JsonWebKey".
            Each of these is connected to 
            the ellipse labeled as "VerificationMethod"
            with a connecting line styled as Superclass.
          </p>

          <p>
            Two boxes, styled as Property and labeled as "secretKeyMultibase"
            and "publicKeyMultibase", are connected to the ellipse
            labeled as "Multikey" with a connecting line styled as Domain Of.
            Each of these boxes is also connected to the shape in the Proof
            section styled as Datatype and labeled as "multibase",
            with connecting lines styled as Range.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, two boxes, styled as Property and labeled "secretKeyJwk" 
            and "publicKeyJwk", are connected to the ellipse labeled "JsonWebKey"
            with a connecting line styled as Domain Of. 
            Each of these boxes is also connected to
            a shape styled as Datatype and labeled as "rdf:JSON",
            with connecting lines styled as Range.
          </p>
